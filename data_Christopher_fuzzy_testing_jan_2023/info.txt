Data for UR paper on testing Fuzzy Controller. 

Files are broken up into sen (sensitive), nor (normal), and res (resistant) files. 
For the horizontal and push tasks a pressure sensor broke and only one was working so it is broken up into bicep and tricep files.
This is denoted by the letter at the end of the file b = bicep, t = tricep.

Tasks:
-Horizontal
-Vertical
-Pushing

The fuzzy controller was active during these data collections.

Data collected from:
-Base Device
-Pressure Sensor
